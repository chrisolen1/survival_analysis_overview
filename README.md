# survival_analysis_overview
Brief overview of survival analysis functions, Weibull and exponential distributions, with a few examples. Still struggling to understand the relationship between the linear predictor and the expected value of a Weibull-distributed random response variable. 

Credit to Dobson and Barnett's "An Introduction to Generalized Linear Models" for much of the theoretical content.
